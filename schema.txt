-> NLP backend:
     inputs to get_sentiment:
       threads:List of Threads
       users: Dict of User ID -> User object
       current_user: User object of logged-in user
-> Web backend:
     output of get_sentiment: Dictionary of User ID -> Sentiment
-> Frontend:
     users: Array of User objects
     sentiment: Dict of User ID -> Sentiment
     me: User object for current user

The web backend will call get_sentiment in fbanalysis. get_sentiment will
call code in the NLP backend.
